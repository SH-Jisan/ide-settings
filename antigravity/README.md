# Antigravity IDE Customization Framework

A production-grade, token-optimized customization package for **Google Antigravity IDE**. This repository configures the AI pair programming agent with high-density engineering heuristics, disciplined debugging, defensive security, architectural patterns, progressive technical mentoring, and unified global master files.

## 🏛️ System Architecture

The framework is organized into three complementary layers following the Antigravity Customization Specification, featuring both modular files and unified master files:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph 1. Invariant Rules ["1. Rules"]
        R0[⭐ global.md]
        R1[general.md]
        R2[coding-standards.md]
        R3[debugging.md]
        R4[security.md]
        R5[problem-solving.md]
        R6[learning-mode.md]
    end

    subgraph 2. Domain Skills ["2. Skills"]
        S0[⭐ global/SKILL.md]
        S1[code-review]

        S6[software-architecture]
        S7[technical-learning]
        S8[technical-research]
    end

    subgraph 3. Slash Workflows ["3. Workflows"]
        W0[⭐ /global]

        W8[/learn]
    end

    Rules --> Skills --> Workflows
